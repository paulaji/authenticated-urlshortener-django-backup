npx create-react-app frontend // start react app and call it frontend
npm start // to start the react app

created dirs: components, context, pages and utils under src

/////
/////
/////
/////
/////

npm install react-router-dom // to install react router

after setting up router, routes and route, we need to set-up private routes which are accessible say when we are logged in
therefore, under utils, we write js login for outlets and navigations

inorder to retrieve data from the backend, like the user info, token info etc.
under context dir, we create AuthContext.jsx

our token object contains:
access token
refresh token
username (which we custom encoded into it)
inorder to access these, we can use an npm library which will decode the token object

npm install jwt-decode // token decoder

/////
/////
/////
/////
/////

parse vs stringify
stringify: to convert javascript object into json/string
parse: to convert json/string into javascript object

since in the backend we have set the access token time as 5 minutes, we need to write a function to update the access token every 5 minutes

importing bootstrap for visual aesthetics
adding absolute links to the backend to access different services
